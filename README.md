## Overview

This project implements an algorithm to detect communities in networks using the **Distance Quality function**. 
The goal is to identify clusters of nodes by maximizing the distance quality function and comparing the results with other community detection metrics like the modularity function. 
It also includes tools for visualization and performance evaluation of the detected communities.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed:

- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **NetworkX library**
- **Numpy library**
- **Scipy library**
- **Matplotlib library** *(optional, for visualization)*
- **Gephi** *(optional, for community visualization)*

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ioannisam/community-detection.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd community-detection
   ```

2. **Install the required Python libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install numpy networkx scipy matplotlib
   ```

   *Alternatively, you can use another method to install the requirements.*

3. **Run the Python script:**

   ```bash
   cd src
   ```

   ```bash
   python distance_quality.py
   ```

4. **(Optional) Use Gephi for advanced visualization:**

   - Export the graph data in a format compatible with Gephi.
   - Open the exported file in Gephi to visualize the communities.
