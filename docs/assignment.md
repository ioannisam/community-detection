# Assignment: Community Detection in Networks

## Description

The assignment involves designing and implementing an algorithm that uses the **distance quality function** (page 58 of the presentation) for detecting communities in networks.

---

## Data

You can use the following network as data for your development, which contains **1005 vertices** and **25,571 edges** [link here], as well as any other network from [this link]. During development, use small networks and later test your algorithm on larger ones.

---

## Methodology (Recommended)

1. Develop the algorithm in **Python**.
2. Use the **NetworkX** library.
3. Use **Gephi** for visualizing the communities.
4. Compare the communities generated by your algorithm with those produced using the **modularity function**.
5. Implement the computation of the quality function and an algorithm to find the clustering that maximizes it.

---

## Deliverables

1. Python code.
2. Gephi files containing the communities.
3. A document describing your algorithm and the computational experiments for comparison.

## Grading - Submission

- The assignment must be submitted via email as a zip file containing the above deliverables by the examination date.
- If the grade of the regular or resit exam is greater than or equal to 5, the assignment will add **+2** points to the final grade.
- The grade of the assignment will not be retained for subsequent years or exams.
